# ASCII-Rainbow

ASCII-Rainbow creates ASCII art images/logos in rainbow! Simple as that.

> Why?

Because it looks cool!

</br>

#### How to use (currently):

1. Open [pageScraper.js](https://github.com/PiPinecone/ASCII-Rainbow/blob/main/src/pageScraper.js)

2. Change  the value of `inputText` to your desired string (unfortunately does not support spaces, punctuation, or special characters at this time)

3. Run [pageScraper.js](https://github.com/PiPinecone/ASCII-Rainbow/blob/main/src/pageScraper.js), and your image is generated as `out.png`

</br>

#### *Hopefully\* Coming Soon/Eventually:

- **Web application**

- Add support for spaces, punctuation, & special characters

- Background options

- Increased image generation speed

- Option to make rainbow by ASCII character

- More color & font options

- Better organized code
